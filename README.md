# Context and Motivation
<div align="justify">
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a comprehensive database resource that integrates genomic, chemical, and systemic functional information. Specifically, KEGG metabolic maps provide a visual representation of metabolic pathways, offering insights into the complex biological systems. KEGGCharter emerges as a tool designed to superimpose differential gene expression and taxonomy information onto KEGG metabolic maps, utilizing Biopython for manipulation and visualization. Presently, KEGGCharter depicts differential gene expression and gene taxonomic assignment as separate entities on the maps. This separation limits the utility in directly associating microbial identities with gene expression data within a unified visual context.

## Objective of the project
<div align="justify">
In this work, the plots of KEGGCharter will be expanded to include multi-level representation of gene expression information. The work will involve developing new interactive representations over the currently outputted plots, to allows the inclusion of more information in metabolic maps.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Dive deeper into the metabolic pathways with interactive elements that reveal intricate details of gene expression and microbial taxonomy in a singular, cohesive map.
- **Multi-Level Taxonomic Representation**: Navigate through various taxonomic levels directly on the KEGG maps, enriching the contextual understanding of the data.
- **Direct Data Access**: Obtain numeric values and detailed information with just a click, simplifying data analysis and interpretation.
- **Enhanced Connectivity**: Seamlessly access related online databases through embedded links and cross-references, expanding the research horizon.
