# Context and Motivation
<div align="justify">
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a comprehensive database resource that integrates genomic, chemical, and systemic functional information. Specifically, KEGG metabolic maps provide a visual representation of metabolic pathways, offering insights into the complex biological systems. KEGGCharter emerges as a tool designed to superimpose differential gene expression and taxonomy information onto KEGG metabolic maps, utilizing Biopython for manipulation and visualization. Presently, KEGGCharter depicts differential gene expression and gene taxonomic assignment as separate entities on the maps. This separation limits the utility in directly associating microbial identities with gene expression data within a unified visual context.

## Overview
<div align="justify">
KEGGCharter Enhanced is a pioneering tool designed to bridge the gap between complex omics datasets and metabolic pathway visualization. By innovatively integrating differential gene expression data with taxonomy directly onto KEGG metabolic maps, our tool offers a holistic view of microbial activity and its implications in various biological processes. This enhanced version of KEGGCharter leverages the power of Biopython and introduces interactive JavaScript elements to elevate the analytical capabilities of researchers and enthusiasts alike.
