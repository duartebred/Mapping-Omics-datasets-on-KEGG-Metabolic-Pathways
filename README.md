# Mapping Omics datasets on KEGG Metabolic Pathways

##

<div align="justify">
KEGGCharter is a tool developed for representing differential gene expression and taxonomy in KEGG metabolic maps (https://github.com/iquasere/KEGGCharter). KEGGCharter uses Biopython to superimpose information on KEGG maps. This information is represented in the form of colored boxes, superimposed over the boxes representing enzymatic function. Both differential gene expression and gene taxonomic assignment are represented, but separately, not in the same map, which would be useful to link microbial identity to gene expression in only one image. A possible solution would be to include interactive elements in KEGGCharter’s outputs, in the form of Javascript objects. An example of this approach are Krona plots, where pie charts can be explored at multiple levels (for an example see: https://iquasere.github.io/reCOGnizer/) by interacting with the plots, made with Javascript. The simple PNG plots of KEGGCharter would benefit greatly from becoming more interactive. For example, numeric values could be directly obtained from the plot, and multiple taxonomic levels could be included. In addition, links and cross-references to online databases could be made available.



This project was developed by student [Duarte Velho](https://github.com/duartebred) (PG53481), under the guidance of João Sequeira (PHD student), Andreia Salvador (Phd) and Miguel Rocha (Phd), in collaboration with the Center of Biological Engineering - University of Minho (CEB-UM).

This repository was created as part of the UC Project (2023/24), of the Master's Degree in Bioinformatics at the School of Engineering of the University of Minho, and aims to bring together the scripts, notebooks and built throughout the work, as well as articles in their different versions, presentation slides and all relevant supplementary material (data, results, software developed, etc.).
This repository stands out for the originality and authorship of the written code.
